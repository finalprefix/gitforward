This tool is meant to enable people to walk through the list of commits in a git repo.

I built this to use in a presentation so I can demonstrate code in different stages of development without having to type it all in.

Here is the output of python gitforward.py

usage: gitforward.py [-h] [-n] [-p] [-s] [-e] [-b BRANCH] [-i INDEX] [-l] [-r]
                     [-t] [-o REPOSITORY]

Gitforward helps you step easily from one commit to another, using a few
simple directives.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --next            Next commit
  -p, --prev            Previous commit
  -s, --start           First commit
  -e, --end             Last commit
  -b BRANCH, --branch BRANCH
                        Branch to checkout
  -i INDEX, --index INDEX
                        Index of the commit in Gitforward's list to checkout
  -l, --list            Display all commits
  -r, --reset           Reset data
  -t, --tests           Run tests
  -o REPOSITORY, --repository REPOSITORY
                        The git repository to work with
